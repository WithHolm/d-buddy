- [completed] Add more granular tracing to `run:main_loop`: The most critical next step is to identify what part of the run:main_loop is consuming the majority of the unaccounted ~240-250ms. This will involve adding additional tracing::info_span! macros to other significant code blocks within src/main.rs's main loop.
- [completed] Implement identified optimizations for `rendering_list`: Proceed with the optimizations already suggested in instructions.md, specifically focusing on Cow<'_, str> for string handling and pre-allocating Vec<Span> for ratatui Text Construction.
- [completed] Investigate `get_process_info` call patterns: Determine how frequently get_process_info is invoked within a single main_loop iteration. Even if individual calls are fast (microseconds), frequent calls could lead to significant cumulative overhead.
- [completed] Run the application with logging enabled to generate new logs with granular tracing.
- [completed] Analyze the new log file to identify bottlenecks within the `main_loop`.
- [completed] Implement lazy rendering for `ListItem`s: Only generate and render visible items within the scroll viewport.
- [completed] Measure the performance improvement after implementing lazy rendering.
- [completed] Optimize `drawing_ui` function in `src/ui.rs`
  - [completed] Change `filtered_items` parameter to a slice (`&[Item]`) to avoid cloning in `main.rs`.
  - [completed] Cache static Line and Paragraph widgets to reduce repetitive work.
  - [completed] Add more granular tracing spans to pinpoint exact `render_widget` bottlenecks.
  - [completed] Optimize `render_main_message_list` performance.
