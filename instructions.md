# D-Buddy

tui using rust to read dbus signals stream

* use rust as language
* ratatui as tui library
* use zbus as dbus library
* terminal should at the start just be a rolling log lits of things that happening
* if a message contains added data, it should be possible to press s or space of something to see the data. we can work with showing the data in a simplified formaet later
* i need to easily see and filter the data (who sent it, where its going, any return data, etc)
